**Description:** This app takes a traditional form of professional business conduct, the business card, into a more practical and modern design. In one page, we have a display of a simple business card, with one's picture, name, email, phone number, company, position, website, and unique code clearly visible. We imagined this page to be for any users that wanted to display their information for others like in a career fair. There is also a feature to add other users into your contacts using their distinct code. Your added contacts would appear in another tab, which lists basic information about each of your contacts. This would be the core networking component of this app, where one can connect with others using the app. This would be useful in a professional environment where passing a simple code can get you all relevant information about an associate.   

**How this app meets requirements:**  

For backend, the requirements were:
1) Designing an API, using database modeling, and implementing it using the Flask boilerplate code provided.  
2) Deployment to Google Cloud.  
  
We completed both of these requirements because to model users and contacts we used SQLAlchemy and modeled the data using the various database methods we learned in class. For our app, we also designed the API using Flask, creating routes for the front-end to interact with. Finally, we used the Google Cloud Platform to deploy our app so that it could be run remotely and so our IOS developers could interact with it.
